# Quantum Control with Neural Networks: PINN and QubiNN

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks, training data, and saved models used in the project **"Quantum Control with Neural Networks: PINN and QubiNN"**, which explores the application of neural networks for single-qubit quantum control tasks.

## Project Overview

The project investigates two neural network architectures:
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** Incorporates the Schr√∂dinger equation to enforce physical consistency in predicting control fields and expectation values.
- **QubiNN:** A purely data-driven feedforward neural network used as a baseline for comparison.

Both models were trained and benchmarked using data generated via QuTiP simulations. The results highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, physical consistency, and computational efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Training Data Generation**:
   - The `training_data.ipynb` notebook uses QuTiP to generate control fields and expectation values for diverse target states on the Bloch sphere.
2. **Model Training**:
   - The `QuPINN.ipynb` and `QubiNN.ipynb` notebooks train the respective models on the generated data.
3. **Benchmarking**:
   - The `benchmarking.ipynb` notebook evaluates the models on test target states, comparing their performance against QuTiP simulations in terms of accuracy, fidelity, and computational efficiency.

## Results Summary

- **Performance**:
  - QubiNN excels in predicting expectation values and achieves higher computational efficiency.
  - PINN slightly outperforms in control field predictions but is more computationally intensive.
- **Speedup**:
  - Both models achieve significant speedup compared to QuTiP simulations, with QubiNN achieving up to ~5000x faster predictions.

For detailed results and visualizations, refer to the `benchmarking.ipynb` notebook.
